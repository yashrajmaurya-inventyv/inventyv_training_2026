## How to Use

Each file contains a specific challenge with function definitions and test cases. Run them individually to verify your solutions work correctly:

```bash
node filename.js
```

## Learning Path

These exercises progress from basic concepts to more advanced JavaScript features:
1. Start with hello-world.js for basics
2. Move through simple logic and functions (lasagna, freelancer-rates)
3. Practice array manipulation (fruit-picker, lucky-numbers)
4. Explore object-oriented and complex logic (amusement-park, assembly-line)
5. Master destructuring and transformations (elyses exercises)

## Topics Covered

- Functions and parameters
- Conditionals (if/else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Arrays and array methods
- Objects and properties
- String manipulation
- Destructuring
- Ternary operators
- Higher-order functions
- Arrow functions
