# Logic Building Flowcharts

This repository contains a collection of **logic building flowcharts** created to improve problem-solving skills and understanding of programming fundamentals.  
Each problem is first designed as a **flowchart** and then implemented using simple and clear code.

All flowcharts for this project are designed in **Figma** and can be viewed using the single link provided below.

## 📘 Project Description

The main goal of this project is to:
- Build strong **logical thinking**
- Understand how to convert **flowcharts into code**
- Practice decision making and looping logic
- Solve problems under **specific constraints**

Each section below represents one logic problem along with its flowchart and code.
