- **factory-sensors.ts** - Error handling with custom exception classes
- **train-driver.ts** - Destructuring and spread operator usage
- **vehicle-purchase.ts** - Purchase decision logic with ternary operators
- **windowing-system.ts** - Window management system logic with classes

### Advanced Features

- **service.ts** - Promise exercise (practice with Promises and async/await)

## How to Use

Each file contains a specific challenge with function definitions and test cases. These are TypeScript implementations with proper type annotations:

```bash
npx ts-node filename.ts
```

Or compile and run:

```bash
tsc filename.ts
node filename.js
```

## Learning Path

These exercises progress from basic concepts to more advanced TypeScript features:

1. **Basics** - Start with hello-world.ts for basics
2. **Functions & Logic** - Move through simple logic and functions (lasagna, freelancer-rates)
3. **Arrays** - Practice array manipulation (fruit-picker, lucky-numbers)
4. **Advanced Types** - Explore interfaces, type guards, and custom types (amusement-park, assembly-line)
5. **Destructuring** - Master destructuring patterns (elyses exercises)
6. **Error Handling** - Learn exception handling (factory-sensors)
7. **Asynchronous** - Master Promises and callbacks (service, fruit-picker)

## Topics Covered

- Functions and parameters
- Conditionals (if/else, ternary operators)
- Loops (for, while, for...of, forEach)
- Arrays and array methods (map, filter, reduce, slice, etc.)
- Objects and interfaces
- String manipulation and regular expressions
- Destructuring assignment
- Spread operator
- Arrow functions
- Higher-order functions and callbacks
- Closures
- Type annotations and type guards
- Custom exception classes
- Promises and async/await patterns
- Template literals

## TypeScript Specific Features

These exercises leverage TypeScript's type system:

- **Interfaces** - Define object shapes (amusement-park.ts, appointment-time.ts)
- **Type Annotations** - Explicit function signatures and variable types
- **Type Guards** - Checking and narrowing types (assembly-line.ts)
- **Union Types** - Multiple possible types for variables
- **Tuples** - Fixed-length arrays with specific types
- **Generics** - Reusable type-safe components
- **Classes** - Object-oriented programming patterns
- **Error Classes** - Custom error types and exception handling

## Getting Started

1. Review the TypeScript basics in hello-world.ts
2. Work through simpler exercises first (lasagna.ts, freelancer-rates.ts)
3. Progress to more complex types and patterns (amusement-park.ts)
4. Study advanced patterns like destructuring and closures
5. Explore error handling and asynchronous patterns

All exercises include practical examples of real-world TypeScript usage patterns and best practices.
